How to configure retention strategies
=====================================

Retention strategies allow you to decide when jobs have to be deleted from the database.

SHQCommandsQueues bundle makes possible to set the retention strategies on three different levels:

1. On the bundle level: you set general rules that are applied by all Daemons for all queues;
2. On the Daemon level: you set rules that are applied to all the jobs in all the queues managed by the Daemon;
3. On the queue level: you set rules that are applied for the jobs in the specific queue.
